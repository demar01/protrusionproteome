Description: protrusionproteome package provides the infrastructure in R to 
    automate the analysis of proteomics data derived from TMT protrusion 
    purification proteomics experiments. It requires tabular input
    (i.e. proteinGroups.txt files) generated by MaxQuant software for
    quantitative analysis of raw mass spectrometry data. 
    It uses SummarizedExperiments objects to handle and process high-throughput 
    mass spectrometry data. Functions provided in the package enable filtering,
    og2 transformation, TMT protrusion/cell-bodies ratios calculation and median 
    substation. It provides tools for QC checks of protrusion purification 
    efficiency, protease efficiency and TMT incorporation. It is also 
    includes tools for statistical testing of significantly enriched protein 
    categories in cell protrusions.
